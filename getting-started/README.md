## Python Quickstart

Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

Let's write our first Python file, called `hello.py`, which can be done in any text editor:

`hello.py:`
```bash
print("Hello, World!")
```

Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:

```bash
C:\Users\Your Name>python hello.py
```

The output should be:
```bash 
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.
